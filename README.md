# C++ Config Framework

The purpose of this config framework is to simplify creation and loading of config files for C++ applications.

The framework can be used to create cross-platform applications, since it is using only Qt and STL libraries.

It is recommended to build the C++ config framework, the plugins and the application with the same development environment to avoid the problem of ABI incompatibility between compilers and used libraries.
